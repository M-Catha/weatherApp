# weatherApp

A simple weather app that pulls in weather data for the user based on location.

Uses the [IP Info](http://ipinfo.io/developers/getting-started) to pull in relevant location data and passes it to the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/current) to pull weather data.

A corresponding background image (should) be generated based on the weather returned.

Build using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery.
